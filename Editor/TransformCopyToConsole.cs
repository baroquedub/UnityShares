/// You must place the script in a folder named Editor in your project's Assets folder for it to work properly.
/// Select an object in the scene hierarchy, then right click on the Transform component and select 'Copy To Console'. 
/// This copies the local position, rotation, and scale of the selected object to the clipboard, and paste the values as text to the console.
/// If you wish, you can then select another object and right click on its Transform component and select Paste Position / Rotation / Scale to apply any of these as independent values (instead of the entire component). 
/// NB Both objects must either be at the root of the scene hierarchy or within the same parent for the transform to be applied properly.
